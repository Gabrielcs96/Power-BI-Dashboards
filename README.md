<h2><span>Alura Pets</span></h2>


In this specific example I followed a step-by-step course to create a dashboard for a pet store. In it I used only two extensions ( the image grid filter and the text filter ) to enrich the Dashboard information.

The databases were extracted from the course and it took less than 5 minutes of treatment for them to be excellent.

<h2><span> Sales Analysis </span></h2>


In this example, I developed a dashboard to analyze the sales of an engine company.
This company sells engines for cars, trains, planes and others vehicles and also sells engines for toys.

The databases were extracted from internet and it took less than 15 minutes to be ready for use.
